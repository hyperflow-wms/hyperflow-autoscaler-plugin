= Autoscaler

Alternative to [Kubernetes Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler), that is focused on _Hyperflow_ engine. It is intended to provide better scaling results, by utilizing workflow details and predictions and taking proper action according to selected _scaling policy_.

Scaling kubernetes infrastructure is strictly related with provider, so there has to be implemented interface for it - currently _Google Cloud Platform_ only is supported.
